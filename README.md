# How to Get Unbanned on Farlight 84 (2025 Guide) 🚀

Getting banned from Farlight 84 can be a real pain, especially if you’re convinced it was an oopsie on the game’s part. Fear not! This straightforward guide will walk you through what to do if your account got banned and show you how to appeal it like a pro to get back in the game ASAP.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did you get banned the moment you made a shiny new account, or does the ban follow you around no matter what? Chances are, you’re **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! This means Farlight 84 has blacklisted your PC hardware, so even fresh accounts get no love.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check your emails or any notifications from Farlight 84 or its developers to find the scoop on why you got banned. Common reasons include:
- Using cheats, hacks, or third-party tools  
- Being toxic, harassing other players, or generally making a scene  
- Sharing accounts or suspicious account activity  

**Pro tip:** Always give the game’s Terms of Service a quick look before hammering out an appeal.
